						<h2>About Drake</h2>
						<p1><strong>Who is Drake?</strong></p1>
						<p>The multi Grammy award-winning rapper Drake has had two shots at fame — and nailed them both. He first came to prominence with the 
							teen soap Degrassi: The Next Generation in the role of Jimmy Brooks, a wheelchair-handicapped character that he played for seven years. 
							After leaving the show he became one of the biggest rappers in the world after signing a deal with Lil Wayne's label Young Money 
							Entertainment. He is rarely out of the headlines, whether it's for dating Rihanna, founding his own record label (OVO Sound), 
							or fronting the NBA’s Toronto Raptors as the team's global ambassador. It's no surprise that Jay-Z has labeled him the "Kobe Bryant of hip-hop."
						</p>
						<p1><strong>Upbringing</strong></p1>
						<p>Born Aubrey Drake Graham on October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Canada, Drake grew up with music in his blood. His father, 
							Dennis Graham, was a drummer for the legendary rock star Jerry Lee Lewis. His uncle, Larry Graham, played bass for 
							Sly and Family Stone. Drake said his mother Sandi Graham also hails from a "very musical" family, and his grandmother 
							babysat Aretha Franklin. Drake came from an eclectic and unique ethnic and religious background. His father is an African American 
							Catholic and his mother is a white Canadian Jew. Speaking about his personal identity, Drake said, "At the end of the day, I consider 
							myself a Black man because I'm more immersed in Black culture than any other. Being Jewish is kind of a cool twist. It makes me unique."
						</p>
						<p>
							Drake's parents divorced when he was just five years old and he was raised by his mother in Forest Hill, an affluent and predominantly 
							Jewish neighborhood in Toronto. He attended Jewish day school, had a bar mitzvah at age 13 and observed the Jewish High Holy Days with 
							his mother. "My mom has always made Hanukkah fun," Drake recalled, "When I was younger, she gave cool gifts and she'd make latkes." 
							Despite his Jewish upbringing, Drake has said he felt isolated at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, a predominantly white high school. 
							He has said that "nobody understood what it was like to be Black and Jewish," but added that "being different from everyone else just made 
							me a lot stronger."
						</p>
						<p1><strong>Future and Legacy</strong></p1>
						<p>
							Drake has asserted himself as a trailblazer in the creative world. Drake released his mixtape So Far Gone in 2009 and his massive influence
							in the hip-hop and contemporary music space has commanded the market since, with no end in sight. Drake now holds the record for the most number
							one hits on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Chart. Drake has catapulted into stardom not only as an artist, but as a cultural maven with October’s Very
							Own. Sharing the story of the thriving music scene in Toronto, Drake has built out OVO from a small-scale blog about his crew to an all-
							encompassing lifestyle brand, including his clothing company, his record label OVOSOUND and his annual OVOFEST. Drake has reached great heights
							in recent years and he continues to create and dominate the global market.
